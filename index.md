# About

As a Solutions Architect, I focus on designing reliable systems that solve real-world problems, specializing in 3D computation and visualization. I enjoy tinkering with hardware projects and reverse engineering while occasionally contributing to open-source projects.

In the blog section of this website, I aim to document some of the interesting projects I'm currently working on.
